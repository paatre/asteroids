# Asteroids

This is a simple implementation of the classic Asteroids game using Pygame.

The game was created as a learning expereience to get familiar with Pygame
and practice object-oriented programming in Python. The game developmet was
facilitated by a course on Boot.dev authored by Sarah Schulte:
https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids-python.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame 2.6.1

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone
uv run main.py
```

## TODO

Here are some features that could be added in the future:

- Add a scoring system
- Implement multiple lives and respawning
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- Add acceleration to the player movement
- Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- Add a background image
- Create different weapon types
- Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- Add a shield power-up
- Add a speed power-up
- Add bombs that can be dropped
